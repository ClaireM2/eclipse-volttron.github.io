&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>"</b>ACE IoT Solutions utilizes Eclipse VOLTTRON, a cost-effective open-source platform as a key part of ACE Aerodrome,
a data collection, management, and visualization platform. Utilizing ACE Aerodrome, customers acquire, process, store, and analyze data to meet their
energy efficiency and building operation optimization objectives. ACE IoT’s current customers range from hospitals, office buildings and schools to
multi-family residential buildings, smart greenhouses and even an MLB stadium. PNNL’s FY25 priorities for Eclipse VOLTTRON, including the development of 
enhanced tooling for deploying the modularized code base with additional utility signal integration will help streamline deployment and management of ACE Aerodrome
and expand the viable deployment environments to include medium and smaller-sized buildings – a critical 
objective on the way to achieving the DoE’s 2050 decarbonization goals.<b>"</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;   <b>"</b>ecoLong is an energy technology startup that is committed to building resilient communities by leveraging interconnected and smart devices. 
 By integrating Eclipse VOLTTRON, a secure, cost-effective open-source platform as a part of ecoLong's energy management and virtual power plant solutions, ecoLong 
strives to build best in class enterprise-grade technology solutions to actively monitor, optimally control, and intelligently manage energy assets and create grid-interactive 
 and efficient communities at scale. The priorities PNNL has set forth for FY25 are 
 of particular interest to ecoLong, including the development of enhanced deployment tooling for the new modularized code base along with
 support for additional utility signals that would unlock grid-interactive efficient buildings. <b>"</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>"</b>Since 2021, Volttron has played a significant role within EPRI’s energy storage research. The open source nature of the tool paired with its enthusiastic and 
supportive community have allowed EPRI researchers to efficiently and affordably implement this technology within our controls, emerging energy storage technology, and microgrid 
research. Although EPRI’s current use cases (energy storage system controls) are not technically within Volttron’s  smart building automation scope, the tool has proven more than capable in these contexts <b>"</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>"</b>The open source component of Eclipse VOLTTRON is revolutionary; it gives many residential and small commercial
buildings a chance to be smart, while allowing all of us to contribute to the technology.<b>"</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>"</b>Instead of using a commercial occupancy sensor, we built a driver in Eclipse VOLTTRON to connect a $2 motion sensor. We estimate our low-cost Eclipse VOLTTRON solution can save 20% on energy and make building occupants much more comfortable.<b>"</b>
